Getting started with Iron Curtain 2 development. 

==Debian Install==
For fake display.
sudo apt-get install python-pygame

==Command Line Interface==
To test locally first run: LocalDisplay.py
Then run Cli.py

example input:
p
movingHue(red)
r
{'hueFrameRate':0.03}
p
movingHue(rainbow)

For testing, you are still using UDP sockets. They are pretty computation intensive, but this is to assure that the code would run with the led panel


It has autocomplete for the functions and patterns

==Improving performance==
Function calls are pretty expensive when using the python compiler.  Instead of using the default compiler, use pypy

for Debian:
apt-get install pypy
example:
pypy Cli.py

This will make the code 2 to 4 times more efficient.

====TODO===
[]Integrate audio
[]separate functions that are inside patterns to a separate file and organize them
[x]Write saver and importer
[]Standardize the input to functions
[x]Decorator to make functions that take patternInputs and extra parameters  take patterns and extra parameters
[] list function list the name of the input variables to functions.
[] Find a way to make it clear that certain functions take arguments
[] split CLI in multiple files
[] Mock audio processing
