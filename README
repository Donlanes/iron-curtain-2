Getting started with Iron Curtain 2 development. 

To minimize the risks of version clashes or other incompatibilities it is recommended to install virtualenv for python, which "is a tool to create isolated Python environments."

==Virtual env setup==
Follow the guide from: http://docs.python-guide.org/en/latest/dev/virtualenvs/

Install virtualenv using pip
[sudo] pip install virtualenv

Setup your virutal environment inside the project directory:
virtualenv venv
virtualenv -p /usr/bin/python2.7 venv
source venv/bin/activate

Now you can install packages using pip and all of them will be instaled in this environment. 

To return to your standard environment simply write deactivate.


This part of the guide will assume you are in a unix environment. It has been tested in ubuntu.


==Linux Install==
First install virtual env.
sudo pip install virtualenv

For fake display.
sudo apt-get install python-pygame
